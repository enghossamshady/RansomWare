#explaining the tecneque of the ransome

first the python script used to scan the files of the device with the extensions of the list put in the script then it returns all the
pahts of these extensions and you can put the path that you wanna begain from i have selected C:\ and after that taking the result 
to the enc function which is responsible for encrypting and reading the files and i used the tecnique of deleting the content of the 
file that is imposible to return data cause the space was busy then after that making key of encryption and it is AES with counter mode 
and if you want it more advanced you can encrypt the key by using RSA encrytion. here are many things advanced like making file encrypt
itself after finishing its task to prevent anyone from analysing it
