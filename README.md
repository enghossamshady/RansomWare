# RansomeWare
-----------------------------------------
"This is a real ransomeware , its code is fully commented not to harm your device and that is for only educational purpose "
I'm not responsible for the misuse of this ransome 

----------------------------------
## explaining the tecneque of the ransome

first the python script used to scan the files of the device with the extensions of the list put <br />
in the script then it returns all thpahts of these extensions and you can put the path that you <br />
wanna begain from i have selected C:\ and after that taking the result to the enc function which <br />
is responsible for encrypting and reading the files and i used the tecnique of deleting the content <br />
of the file that is imposible to return data cause the space was busy then after that making key of <br />
encryption and it is AES with counter mode and if you want it more advanced you can encrypt the key<br />
by using RSA encrytion. here are many things advanced like making file encryptitself after finishing<br />
its task to prevent anyone from analysing it <br />

the most advanced method of preventing the ransome from encrypting data many times I copied the path of <br />
it to appdata with windows.exe and moved it to the memory of HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run <br />
to make it encrypt all the new files and data every time the device restart and make it impossible to be <br />
killed before encrypting itself it makes messge for the user in desktop containg all the details the hacker<br />
want from the victim <br />
