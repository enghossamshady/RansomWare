# RansomeWare
"This is a real ransomeware , its code is fully commented not to harm your device and that is for only educational purpose "
I'm not responsible for the misuse of this ransome 

# explaining the tecneque of the ransome

first the python script used to scan the files of the device with the extensions of the list put in the script then it returns all the
pahts of these extensions and you can put the path that you wanna begain from i have selected C:\ and after that taking the result 
to the enc function which is responsible for encrypting and reading the files and i used the tecnique of deleting the content of the 
file that is imposible to return data cause the space was busy then after that making key of encryption and it is AES with counter mode 
and if you want it more advanced you can encrypt the key by using RSA encrytion. here are many things advanced like making file encrypt
itself after finishing its task to prevent anyone from analysing it 

the most advanced method of preventing the ransome from encrypting data many times I copied the path of it to appdata with windows.exe and moved it to the memory of HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run to make it encrypt all the new files and data every time the device restart and make it impossible to be killed before encrypting itself it makes messge for the user in desktop containg all the details the hacker want from the victim
